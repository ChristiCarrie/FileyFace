            <div class="gray">
                <p>Here are some future updates we plan on implementing in the coming month or two. Overall, we seek to make our AI decision making algorithms more robust and provide more features to further increase the efficacy and convenience of our product.</p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Automatic Sort Upon Installation</strong>
                    <p>This feature would allow the software to automatically sort all of one's pre-existing files and folders upon installation.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>History Bar</strong>
                    <p>This history bar will keep a chronological record of all the files downloaded as well as the times they were downloaded. This allows users who forget where a certain file is stored to find that file in the history bar and, from there, track its location.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>More Robust AI Methods</strong>
                    <p>We seek to expand our AI to use more information when classifying files, including the contents of that website, which can be accessed through web scraping. We also plan to use the date accessed of the files/folders as well as recently downloaded files to further inform our AI.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>User Interface Updates</strong>
                    <p>We plan to include an interactive directory tree in our pop ups in order to visually and intuitively show where our algorithm will place a new file.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Customisation in Setup Wizard</strong>
                    <p>We plan to create a setup wizard that allows users to easily configure the settings upon installation. One such customiseable feature is to have the program ignore certain file types that the user specifies, such as .exe.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Converting File Types</strong>
                    <p>This will allow FileyFace to automatically convert between file types when they are downloaded. This would be useful if a user would like all of their images to be .jpeg files, or all of their word documents to be .pdf files, for example.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Managing Existing Files</strong>
                    <p>We plan on scanning for currently existing files on the desktop to see if they suit a new files location, and deleting any duplicate files that may exist.</p>
                </li>
