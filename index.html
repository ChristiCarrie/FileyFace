            <p>FileyFace was conceived at a late-night dinner/brainstorming session between the team. We were going through our computers and we saw one of our teammate's downloads folder. It was crazy, absolutely everything was in that folder; homework, personal projects, video downloads, random pictures, VS Code, and more. We were laughing about it, and the idea suddenly came to us! An application that could prevent the clutter by addressing the root cause: the initial download.</p>

            <div class="gray">
            <p>Our application focuses on leveraging OpenAI and TextRazor APIs to immediately place a newly downloaded file into its best-suited folder. We use OpenAI to generate the final prediction score for each folder and TextRazor to parse keywords from each document. FileyFace supports multiple file formats, including .pdf, .docx, .pptx, and more! We also use multiple of Python's libraries, including but not limited to: os, shutil, sqlite3, and watchdog. We are combining AI and tech stack to determine the intended folder location of a downloaded file, right when it's first downloaded.</p>
